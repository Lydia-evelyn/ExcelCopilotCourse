[from in Excel, open a chat window with Copilot]

- Highlight all of the rows with clients that have contracts lasting for more than 12 months


- Now format the text in the rows to red if their assigned sales rep is Lydia Evelyn

[Create a new sheet and open it]
- Use the FILTER function to extract rows from the "Partners Masterlist" where the "Contract Length" is a number greater than 12, and "Assigned Sales Rep" is "Lydia Evelyn"

Expected result: Copilot should provide conditional formatting that will apply the requested changes to your document automatically. You should also get a new pivot table or sheet that contains all of the contact information you requested.
