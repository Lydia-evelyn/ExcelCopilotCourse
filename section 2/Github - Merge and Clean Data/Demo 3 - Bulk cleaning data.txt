[from in Excel, open a chat window with Copilot]

- I need to clean the data from the Contest_Entries sheet and put the cleaner version in the Cleaner_Contest_Entries. Can you help me out?

[Try out the formulas that Copilot gives you. If they don't work at first, you might need to follow up with this next prompt]

- Give me the formulas without unnecessary spacing

[If you need further clarification for further instructions, try a prompt like this:]

- Now how do I make it apply to the other rows

[apply Copilot's instructions, and ask questions whenever you need to. There are no silly questions!]
